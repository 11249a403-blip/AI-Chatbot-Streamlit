# Bhavya’s AI Chatbot

**Repository:** [AI-Chatbot-Streamlit](https://github.com/11249a403-blip/AI-Chatbot-Streamlit.git)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for the user interface and the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com) for natural language responses.  
It enables real-time conversational interaction and demonstrates integration between frontend and AI backend systems.

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Interactive chat UI built with Streamlit  
- Supports multiple model selections (e.g., GPT-4O-mini)  
- Maintains chat history between user and bot  
- Easily configurable via API key input and temperature slider

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Libraries  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Streamlit  
- **API:** OpenAI (ChatGPT / GPT models)  
- **Main libraries:** `streamlit`, `openai`

## 🧵 Working Principle  
User enters a message via the Streamlit interface → the message is sent to OpenAI’s GPT model → the model returns a response → the UI displays the response and logs the conversation.  
This loop continues until the user ends the chat.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  
1. Ensure Python 3.12.x is installed (Note: version compatibility is critical)  
2. Open Command Prompt (or terminal) and navigate to project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd path/to/AI-Chatbot-Streamlit
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit openai
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python -m streamlit run chatbot.py
Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted in the sidebar and start chatting!
